Digital Complaint Resolution System (DCRS) is a Java Swing–based desktop application designed to streamline the process of submitting, managing, and resolving complaints within an organization.
It provides three dedicated modules—User, Department, and Admin—each with a fullscreen modern UI featuring gradient backgrounds, consistent styling, and neatly formatted tables.
Users can register, log in, submit complaints with department selection, and track their complaint status, while departments can view assigned complaints, add resolutions, and mark them as solved. 
The Admin module allows viewing all complaints, pending/solved lists, department information, and user details. 
The system includes MySQL database connectivity through JDBC making the overall complaint-handling process faster, transparent, and more efficient.
